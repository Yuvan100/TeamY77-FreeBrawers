<h1> Tips to get New brawlers! </h1>

<h1>I haven't opened a Legendary Brawler in ages!</h1>

 

Legendary Brawlers are not stronger than the rest of the rarities!<br>

If you have not opened a Legendary Brawler, though, it might be a blessing in disguise. <br>The road to master includes your current Brawlers, and as you practice with them,<br> you will be able to open more boxes and eventually find your way to a Legendary Brawler.<br> Patience is a virtue!</P>
